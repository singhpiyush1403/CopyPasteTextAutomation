# CopyPasteTextAutomation
This project demonstrates keyboard automation using Selenium with Java. It opens Google, enters text into the search box, and performs copy-paste operations. The script uses Keys.CONTROL to simulate keyboard shortcuts like Select All, Copy, and Paste. It validates execution by printing the page title after performing the actions.
